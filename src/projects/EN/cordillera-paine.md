The Cordillera Paine is a mountain group in Torres del Paine National Park in Chilean Patagonia. It is located 280 km north of Punta Arenas, and about 1,960 km south of the Chilean capital Santiago. It belongs to the Commune of Torres del Paine in Última Esperanza Province of Magallanes and Antártica Chilena Region. No accurate surveys have been published, and published elevations have been claimed to be seriously inflated, so most of the elevations given on this page are approximate. Paine means "blue" in the native Tehuelche language and is pronounced PIE-nay.
