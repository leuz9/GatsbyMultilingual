## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of this gastby starter up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) & [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your local machine

Open a terminal window and install React & Gatsby's command line tool

```
yarn add react react-dom gatsby-cli
```

### Clone the repo

Clone the repo in the directory of your choice and then move to this new directory

```
git clone https://github.com/charbelchahine/multilingual-gatsby-netlifycms.git
cd multilingual-gatsby-netlifycms
```

Install all dependencies for the prototype

```
yarn install
```

### Development

Start a hot-reloading development environment

```
gatsby develop
```

You will now be able to view the prototype at http://localhost:8000/. Any change you make to your React components will immediately be visible in the browser.

### Sass

Run `yarn sass` before making changes to any of the `.scss` files.

### Set up NetlifyCMS

The following steps-by-steps use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to host the starter from GitHub. Other methods can be used to implement [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org).

1. Sign in or make a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) account
1. Make a **New site From Git** and select GitHub
1. Select the appropriate repo
1. Go to the Identity tab and **Enable Identity**
1. Click on **Settings and usage**
1. Under **Registration** check **Invite only**
1. Under **External providers**, add GitHub, Google etc
1. Under **Services** enable git gateway
1. Go back to the Identiy tab and invite users/yourself
1. Go to your netlify hosted website `/admin/` and login using your credentials to access the CMS

### Configuring NetlifyCMS

In `/static/admin/confiq.yml`, the CMS can be configured. Right now, blog posts are configured to have the same path in english & french; hence the titles are also the same since they are configured to create the path in `gatsby-node.js`.
